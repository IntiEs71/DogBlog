                        So we begin to embark on Summer days, 
                        we'll once again start to spend more time 
                        outside and take our necessary steps to stay 
                        safe in the sun. But we must not forget about 
                        making sure our pets are also safe and cool 
                        during warm days. 

                        Here are some tips to keep your dog safe from the Summer heat. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong> Walk at Non-Peak Hours</strong>
                                <br>
                                If your dog enjoys their daily walks but it's
                                too hot outside. Try seeing if you can walk during
                                non-peak sunny hours, such as early before sunrise
                                or after sunset. Before going out make sure the surfaces
                                outside such as the asphalt and sidewalk are not too hot.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <strong> Carry Plenty of Water </strong>
                                <br>
                                When you do decide to take your dog out, it is
                                important to monitor your dog for any unusual behavior
                                and to check for signs of heat fatigue and heat stroke.
                                It's important to keep your dog well hydrated to avoid
                                fatigue, so be sure to carry plenty of water.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        In order to maintain our dogs' safety it's important to follow these
                        tips and use your best judgement on deciding when it's too hot
                        to go outside or whether we need to take additional 
                        precautionary measures.
